# Optional heavy ML frameworks (install only if you need them)
# Uncomment desired lines and install separately (they are large)
# torch (PyTorch) - verify appropriate CUDA/CPU build for your machine
# Example (CPU-only):
# pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
# Or install a specific torch release, e.g., torch>=2.0

# Optional transformer-based generation (requires torch)
# transformers>=4.40

# tensorflow - CPU build
# tensorflow>=2.12

# Note: Installing these can be slow and require specific system setup.
